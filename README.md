## Overview

This ROS package receives as input a set of waypoints and produces control commands for road vehicles to follow these waypoints. 
A spline interpolator generates a smooth path and a speed profiler calculates fordward velocity from a maximum speed specification and the radius of curvature of the path. Lateral control is based on an optimal LQR controller that is easy to adjust. The controller incorporates a delay compensator to minimize the effect of position readings and actuation delays.
